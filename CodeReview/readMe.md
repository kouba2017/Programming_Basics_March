# 📝 Programming Basics Recap Challenges

Welcome to the **Programming Basics Recap Challenges**! 🚀 This file contains a series of fun and engaging coding tasks designed to reinforce fundamental JavaScript concepts, including:

- Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Operators (`==`, `===`, `&&`, `||`, `%`, etc.)
- Functions (with and without parameters/return values)
- Break statements within loops
- Arrays and built-in methods (`push`, `pop`, `length`, `includes`)
